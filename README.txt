Makes your RSS feeds human-readable. Check out before and after screenshots Â»

== Description ==

RSS Feed Styles improves the appearance of your RSS feeds and make them human-readable. View the screenshots to see the before and after. RSS Feed Styles also adds subscription buttons and social sharing buttons to your RSS Feeds. This allows users to share your posts without an RSS reader.

Your blog's RSS feed is located at http://yoursite.com/feed/ (if you use permalinks) or http://yoursite.com/?feed=rss2 (if you don't use permalinks).

Some users already have an RSS viewer installed on their browsers, so their RSS feeds are already human-readable. However, most users (especially on Google Chrome or Apple Safari) do not have an RSS viewer. This plugin makes your RSS feeds accessible to those users.

Currently supported feed readers:

- Digg Reader
- Feedly
- Inoreader
- AOL Reader
- The Old Reader
- NewsBlur

Currently supported sharing buttons:

- Facebook
- Google+
- Twitter
- Pinterest
- Evernote
- LinkedIn
- Tumblr
- Reddit

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this plugin style my RSS feeds? =

RSS Feed Styles uses Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) to format your RSS feed. It generates HTML from the RSS feeds. Nothing changes aside from appearance. RSS readers will still see the original XML feed.

= I installed the plugin, but it's not doing anything =

You may need to clear your cache and hard refresh the page. Also, this plugin may not work if your browser already has an RSS reader built-in. Try a different browser, perhaps a clean install of Chrome or Safari.

If this doesn't work, please create a support ticket with your RSS feed's URL and your WordPress installation's version. Plugin conflicts and incorrect server configurations can cause issues.
